</h1>
<p><b>Practical Problems</b></p>
<p><b>Following are the common problems we faced: </b>
</p>
<p><b>1. Beaglebone black is not very resilient </b><span style="font-weight: normal">
platform for project which has high physical wear and tear and not
advisable to use for first time builders. We used Beaglebone black
initially but it was not really needed in our case as we just
modified code in ardupilot’s repository. The ardupilot code can be
run by APM, pixhawk or many other platforms which are much more
stable in terms of performance and durability. </span><b>Use
Beaglebone Black only if needed.</b></p>
<p><b>2. MAVProxy motor test: </b><span style="font-weight: normal">
mavproxy’s motortest command takes an input argument which is  a
motor number. However, it does not </span><span style="font-weight: normal">correspond</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
to motor number positions given on ardupilot’s website. In
Ardupilot hexa plus configuration, motor number 2 corresponds to
motor at 6 o’clock position ( exactly behind the controller’s
front )  but , in motor test command it corresponds to a motor at 2
)clock position. If you are running motortest command for each motor
and you are testing motor 1,2,3,4,… in this sequence then motors
should run starting from motor 1 ( usually in front in plus
configuration ) and keep going in clockwise direction if your motors
are connected in right way.</span></p>
<p><b>3. SITL does not replicate exact physical simulation: </b><span style="font-weight: normal">One
of the crash-proof mode which we developed worked in simulation but
it failed in real test. We believe that it was due to untuned PID
parameters and settings we could not </span><span style="font-weight: normal">try
to tune PID because we did not have good harness for drone which will
make it safe</span><span style="font-weight: normal">. </span>
</p>
<p><b>4. At high horizontal velocity the motors may not respond to
change in altitude request.</b></p>
